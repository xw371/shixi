September 16, 2025 in Announcements After much deliberation over the 66 applications we received this summer, we are happy to announce our new bloggers! Please give a warm welcome to: Hala K. ‘29 from Michigan, who built not only robots but also endearing memories at MITES, and knows her best friends better than any online personality test out there. Taylor L. ‘29 from North Carolina, who went on a quest to find a Pink Lemonade Celsius near her hometown, and has much to tell you about the virtues of serif fonts in this day and age. Boheng C. ‘28 from California, who has biked all the way from campus to beaches and shipyards, and liveblogged from the depths of a freezing New England cave. Victor D. ‘27 from California, who cherishes the identities built into the squares and streets of Boston, and finds unfamiliar paths in familiar places to meet new friendly faces. (Hey, that rhymed!) Caleb M. ‘27 from Texas, whose first walk down the Infinite Corridor was during a snowy Boston haze, and loves bagels and sandwiches but HATES bagel sandwiches. They got some banger posts coming soon, so stay tuned! For those who didn’t get selected this time: thank you so much for taking the time and effort to apply.

getting back in the groove by Aiden H. '28,N/A,0,"September 3, 2025","Home Blogs getting back in the groove by Aiden H. '28 🎵groovy groovy🎵 September 3, 2025 in Academics & Research, Classes, How to School Once upon a time in a land far, far away A group of schoolchildren gathered to recount their days. One says they cried, one says they laughed, but they all agreed in one very unfortunate path. That when the leaves fall down, sky turns blue to grey The freshman will forever cease to live in their PNR ways Instead learning the trials that come to all. Beware, the sophomore fall! *** Uh so yeah I’m gonna be a sophomore, and just saying that didn’t feel like dramatic enough of an opening. I wanted it to sound like an old nursery rhyme or something, but I also didn’t care that much so I wrote it in like 3 minutes.⁠01 WITHOUT rhyme zone or AI mind you. so like, speedy But anyway, people say sophomore year is the worst, but it’s also kinda the year class-wise, at least for 10B. You’re done with the GIRs and starting classes specifically for your major, but everyone in the major still has to take them, so the class sizes are still larger and the classes are well-known. Well funny enough (I planned it), this happens to be the first day of classes on campus, so I got an exclusive look into the so-called awful time everyone is having! This will be nothing too crazy, but it is for sure something I will want to look back on at the end of the semester to see if this excitement is just first-week delusion or the start of a new chapter in my MIT career (and feelings towards it). Here are the classes, in order of appearance: 5.07 – Introduction to Biochem (MWF 9:00 AM) I was like a teenager on the phone with their first crush: sitting in the back, kicking my feet, smiling and blushing trying to hide my excitement. I have ALWAYS wanted to take a biochem class. I might seriously take 5.13⁠02 Organic Chemistry II just so I can take 5.08,⁠03 Biochem II depending on how this class goes. It almost feels dissociative to be in this class. I feel like biochem has a lot of topics that we go our whole lives, in and out of the classroom, vaguely knowing that they happen but never really understanding step-by-step. Like babies know they’re alive, kids know we have cells, high schoolers know we metabolize, but no one really knows what is actually going on. To actually be in the class knowing that in like 7th grade I was sitting there thinking “This will all make sense one day” is trippppppy. Judging the syllabus though it’s gonna be pretty lethal… 5.601 – Thermodynamics I (MWF 10:00 AM) I have a love-hate relationship with the little thermodynamics that I know. In high school chem and 5.111,⁠04 gen chem, or officially Principles of Chemical Science I did very well in the thermodynamics units, always finding the work to be fairly easy and not painful to do. Having to sit down and listen to thermodynamics, though, does fill me with enough boredom to tranquilize a horse, or like, Godzilla. I’ll do the pset I’ll learn the topic whatever whatever, but today was just like defining temperature and pressure. Praying we get past PV=nRT in the first week. 18.03 – Differential Equations (MWF 1:00 PM) Long story short I was gonna ASE this class and then missed the sign-up deadline, so I lowkey know the first half of the class, and the second half I’ve heard is harder but very very doable. Most people at MIT take this class anyway, so I have no abundance of people to help me. The professor is a very fun and energetic Russian guy, but he was just reading the lecture notes word for word and maybe adding an example here and there. If it doesn’t get more useful it might be an “Aiden goes to lecture when he doesn’t already know a topic” kinda class. 10.10 – Introduction to Chemical Engineering (MWF 2:00 PM) Every single sophomore who declared 10/10B/10ENG has to take this class right now, so it’s just 44 of us in a room, fresh-faced and wide-eyed trying to figure out basic ChemE. It gives a strong sense of community among us since we’re all sitting in there at the same time, so super cute. On the other hand, the professors and peers described the class as very very challenging. They are either: Trying to hype themselves up and in reality the class is just fine I won’t make it past October Time will tell! 11.041 – Introduction to Housing, Community, and Economic Development (TR 9:30 AM) This is the only class I didn’t have today, so this one will have to remain a mystery in the public eye for now. When I read through all the HASS classes to pick one, this was at the top of my list because: It is so societally and politically important. It is something I could never learn to the same extent on my own outside of an academic environment, full of professionals and hand-selected literature to teach me (whereas I feel some HASS classes are things I could learn/do on my own time without much penalty). It is a 1.5 hour discussion-based class, which means lots and lots of readings!! The final project is to design your own city and ",1,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/getting-back-in-the-groove/
albums i like and why i like them by Kayode D. '27,N/A,0,"September 8, 2025","Home Blogs albums i like and why i like them by Kayode D. '27 pov: i ramble about music and won't shut up September 8, 2025 in Uncategorized I like music. A lot. And I like telling other people about the music that I like. I message my friends fairly often asking if they’ve listened to [insert mildly obscure musician here], and their random album from 2018. I keep having new ones, and I want some way to document why I like the albums that I like. So here is a list of cool musical projects⁠01 Caleb M. 27 complains that people will call it anything but an album. 'LP, project, record, JUST SAY ALBUM' that I like and why I like them. Imagine we’re walking through Newbury Comics, and I see this record, run over to you, and being to yap about why i like it: Beat The Champ [2015] – The Mountain Goats I’m not sure how I found this album, but I love it. It’s like the 5th album put out by The Mountain Goats, and it’s a concept album about Chavo Guerrero, a WWE lucha wrestler that the singer (and presumed protagonist of the album) watched as a kid in Texas. The album follows the boy as he grows up watching Chavo, and the path that Chavo had to walk in his life as a wrestler. I went down a wikipedia rabbit hole one day, so this might all be wrong but this is what I remember: The creator of this album, John Darnielle, didn’t have many good memories with his step father. One point of contact between the two was professional wrestling. The two would frequently go to watch the local circuit of obscure wrestlers where John’s stepdad, Mike, would sometimes be the only person cheering for the heel, or villain. In his preteen years, John became obsessed with wrestling and watched twice a week on a black and white TV. He always rooted for the hero, and whenever they threw out the rulebook against the heel to fight fire with fire, it would ignite something primal in him. His favorite wrestler was Chavo Guerrero Sr. Chavo Guerrero was born the son of Gordy Guerrero, an early pioneer of the Mexican Lucha Libre fighting circuit. The Guerreros had a wrestling ring in their backyard, and Chavo would practice wrestling with his uncle of a similar age, Eddie Guerrero. The two would grow up and join wrestling circuits, eventually making it to WWE. Eddie was known to be a “cheater” in the ring, and would try to get Chavo to fight dirty as well, although Chavo resisted. The two fought in tag team matches and individually, seeing a moderate amount of success, before the Hair Match (climax of the album), in which Chavo took on Eddie, and the loser got their head of long hair shaved by the victor. Eddie passed away on November 13, 2005, and Chavo continued to wrestle in Eddie’s honor. The album shifts from peppy and “wrestlemania!”-esque into a more somber tone, and I think this album hits especially hard when you know the full story. It makes the final track, Hair Match, even more resonant. Thank you Bry for getting me the physical CD of this album for my birthday. Fav. Tracks: Choked Out, Luna The Only Members That Show Up [2018] – Tomtsu This album is amazing. Tomtsu was active from 2018 – 2021, and was based out of Boston. I know, like, 3 Boston Bands and this is one of them. This is an album of complex guitar riffs and absolutely KILLER drum rhythms. I would describe it as “asymmetric” in the best way possible. They have this one song called “This Is Milk” off of their 2021 EP “the last tsupper” where they end with a syncopated 4/4 guitar riff and a non-linear, distinctly NON-4/4 drum solo over it. And this album, their self-titled freshman album, is the beginning of their grungy-nerdy-math rocky-asymmetrical musical sound. And they were in high school when they made this album. HIGH SCHOOL. Puts me to shame. They also have a youtube channel where they recorded a ton of their live shows so you can literally watch the band grow over the years. Fav. Tracks: Tongue Tied, Marmalade The Masquerade [2019] – mxmtoon I listened to mxmtoon for the first time like a week⁠02 a year and a week atp. this blog was basically finished but i lacked the Courage to Change and finish it ago, and this album, The Masquerade, is SO GOOOOD. It’s her first full album, and was released after her senior year of high school. It features the song “prom dress,” which went viral on tiktok in 2018. The album is a big collection of love songs, and it opens with some bangers. Unspoken Words, Prom Dress, Blame Game – a lot of bops. But the most important song in the entire album⁠03 and the turning point is the 6th track, my ted talk. In this song, mxmtoon reveals that she’s never been in love before. She explains that she writes these songs as if she’s an expert, but she’s only fooling herself. I think this singlehandedly makes the album at least 11 times better. Now, not only can you relate to the love songs if you have been in love, but if you haven’t been in love, you can relate to mxmtoon on an even deeper level because you too want these things you don’t really know",2,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/albums-i-like-and-why-i-like-them/
September Equinox Appreciation by Victor D. '27,N/A,0,"September 22, 2025","Home Blogs September Equinox Appreciation by Victor D. '27 A Cambridge Autumn September 22, 2025 in MIT Life Two years ago in freshman year (:O so long ago), I wrote this poem. I had just moved to Cambridge not even 3 months before, and was adjusting to a place radically different from home. In these first few months, I spent a lot of time walking and riding my bike, exploring Cambridge and Greater Boston. I don’t think much has changed about how amazing fall is to me and I’m looking forward to experience it all over again! This post commemorates the Autumn Equinox (which will occur almost exactly when this blog is posted on Monday, September 22nd, 2025 at 2:19 PM Eastern Time). A Cambridge Autumn Red, orange, yellow Red, orange, yellow Once green, now illuminate like fire. The forest transcends mere vegetation And becomes a sea of lava. The wind howls and whispers throughout the night Its haunting song implores me: “Look up from your desk! And out the window to the buildings across the field that glow and gleam like galaxies.” The stars of night are barely visible; city light trumps their radiance The buildings appear twice: once in substance, once in mirror The glassy surface of the river reflects a portal to another world A fabled cosmos brews in the water. Several nights now, I have gone to sleep with a gentle tap on my window As the rain downpours and downpours and downpours And the streets begin turning into channels. Which makes for a fun game on my bike, as I dash between puddles. Other times I’ve found myself caught in the rain Which unfortunately doesn’t understand boundaries But nevertheless I relish feeling it’s cool and gentle touch on my skin As much as I detest when it drenches my socks and shoes. Sometimes I stroll through the neighborhoods Beautiful New England Homes, a hodgepodge of color and character Some homes are amber, others cyan, or even a rich mahogany. Their chromatic dance with the autumnal trees rivals the Impressionist Greats. Thus, I once rode my bike to the Square. And decided to walk the rest of the way, to see the homes and streets lined in the oceans of Fall. Pigeons cooed, winds gushed, but together harmonized a gentle symphony. Porchsitters too waved gleefully, and I smiled and gestured back. Some say the Heavens weep when it rains: “Why did you walk here?” “Because the neighborhoods here are really pretty!” “But the weather is so bad today!” “What do you mean?” “Because there’s no sun; the sky is gray. It was raining” Because it was gray! There was no sun! It was raining! Therefore, it must be miserable. Therefore it must be miserable!? Perhaps it is naivety on my part, as it is seldom gray at home Or simply the honeymoon phase of my arrival here But I simply can’t help but wonder What is poetically miserable, and what is actually miserable. What is actually miserable? Certainly not Cambridge Autumn. November 5th, 2023 My first vivid recollection of Cambridge’s autumn comes from a bike ride in early October when I visited Ebisuya, a former Japanese grocery market in Medford.⁠01 sadly, it closed earlier this year :( As I descended through various neighborhoods of Medford, Sommerville, and Cambridge, the trees and their colorful leaves felt as though they were enveloping me as they blurred along the edges of my peripheral vision. This was my first time ever living through a stereotypical autumn, common in media though almost completely foreign to where I’m from. Here’s some pics I’ve taken of autumn throughout the years in various places in Greater Boston: Killian Court, Cambridge 08/22/2023 Beacon Street, Back Bay (Boston) 08/25/2024 Galaxy Park, Kendall Square (Cambridge) 08/28/2023 Emerald Necklace, Brookline 08/27/2023 An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next And here’s an example of the New England homes I referred to: the ubiquitous triple-decker.⁠02 Three-deckers (triple-deckers) are primarily found in New England, mostly constructed during suburban expansion in the first half the 20th century. i think they're pretty neat. Row of triple-deckers in Worcester, Massachusetts. Where I’m from in Camarillo, California, we have a dry season, a wet season, and interspersed other seasonal periods, like the Santa Ana Winds from the desert and “June Gloom” from the sea. Cambridge is obviously very different but, as you might infer, I’ve enjoyed it a lot (especially the rain)!

cookies by Aiden H. '28,N/A,0,"September 13, 2025","Home Blogs cookies by Aiden H. '28 life lessons through six scrumptious sayings September 13, 2025 in Challenges, How to Human, Miscellaneous Call it big-boned or call it taste, but I’ve always loved cookies.⁠01 ice cream is so meh why wouldn't you eat a cookie instead?? I grew up as a massive baker, and every December I take it as a mission to bake as many cookies as possible and hand them out to people I know–meaning keeping a gallon-sized Ziploc of cookies in my middle school backpack, slipping them under the desk to friends during class. So the other night, on another casual thought spiral about the innumerable delights of cookies, I realized how many idioms about cookies there are, if not the most of any dessert. I count six for cookies, four for cake,⁠02 The icing on the cake, the cake is a lie, to take the cake, and cakewalk one for pie,⁠03 Humble pie and zero for ice cream.⁠04 Aiden: 2 Ice Cream: 0 There can only be one anthropological and etymological answer: cookies are a foundational part of human nature, and their significance is represented in our phrases. Because of this, I’ve been thinking a lot about what cookies could mean to me and MIT culture, and how all the phrases work together. *** Smart cookie (or, doing well) So you grow up “gifted and talented” or whatever. But this is almost definitely a reflection of sociocultural factors and your willingness to be quiet as a child and not your passion about math or whatever. But you enjoy it, but who wouldn’t? Things are easy for a long time, and you don’t walk around telling everyone about how “great” you are, but adults will tell you and eventually you believe it just a little. Eventually you do have to start making a choice, and you make a good one–to try. You actually can be interested in the things you’re doing, and past the expectations of what you should be doing, you do it anyway because a part of you just likes it and it helps you in the long run. Everything is sweet. If you give a mouse a cookie (or, getting addicted to success) Soon you’re not so special, and that’s fine because that’s being a person, but so far your only thing has been being special, so who are you? You’re a person who clings to it. You try even harder. It’s an easy spiral to go down, and one you get tunnel-visioned into every couple weeks without realizing it. If you give a mouse a cookie, it might be able to recognize itself quickly as a junk-food junkie. But if you give a mouse a cookie and then surround it with other cracked-out mice running in circles and snorting chocolate chips, the mouse is gonna think they’re pretty well off. They have “balance” compared to the other mice. And then you snap out of it as soon as you get a little burnt out and remember that nothing is ever that deep that you need to major in finance or understand what YC does.⁠05 I genuinely didn't learn about what it stood for or what they do until last night when HackMIT kids told me You feel trapped in the bubble of it all though, you know? Accept all cookies (or, how much of yourself to give away) You gave your life away to work at age 15, and you’re already pretty tired. You would rather be doing a lot of other things that most teenagers probably would. But now it feels all you have to look forward to is work, because you spent the fun part of life working, and you can’t realistically spend the work part of life just messing around. Adults tell you all the time to enjoy the now, that soon all you’ll have to do is worry about work and bills, which feels ridiculous, because all you do and all you feel you’ve ever done is worry about work. But then every couple days in class, your professors talk about how you’re going to use something in the real workforce one day, and you remember that this whole thing so far hasn’t even been work, it’s literally just been the training. This is still the training? You debate about if you’re committing too much, because on the surface everyone talks about work-life balance, but secretly you know that you still have to be successful on paper to get everything you want. But now what you want is to be successful on paper, so everything is getting hazy. You remember a triangle you saw once: It’s an oversimplification, sure, but you’re also able to trace back everyone’s life ever to the triangle, so you buy into it. You know exactly which one you’ve always given up. Hand in the cookie jar (or, humility) So you realize it’s pretty bad because even your Spotify Daylist is starting to call you out.⁠06 angry crash-out anxiety tuesday evening What do you do when you’re caught red-handed in an emotional nightmare? You project it onto others, duh! You remind yourself that you could have it so much worse and you give advice to others about how to fix their own problems, because if you can subconsciously convince yourself that you’re doing better than others, then that means you’re probably just whining about your problems and they’re not real. And then someone gives you",4,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/cookies/

I have no explanation, only excuses. When I started this project I had big dreams, but now I have big psets. For the past two Tuesdays, the 10pm-11pm time slot on my Google Calendar has been blocked out to finish my Target blog and it didn’t happen either of those times. I feel like I have no time at all or maybe negative time but I still somehow have this stubborn belief that I can do big fun things that contribute nothing towards my to-do list. Life finds a way, I guess. Anyways here’s the vlog <3 https://youtu.be/M-zuz_nZhGY Details: I filmed this with my phone, balanced precariously on the edges of various boxes and tables. I edited it in Adobe Premiere Pro which I get free with my tuition. Most of the voiceover was recorded in one take, somehow. I got most of the bags from the Target in Central Square, as well as one or two from Alpha Delta Phi’s reusable bag rack. All of the sewing supplies were from MAD, with the exception of the red thread I was hand-sewing with, which I pilfered from Math Prize for Girls 2024. Shout out to Tor’s Cabinet of Curiosities, which I watched a lot of while sewing. One day I’m gonna get rich and make my own better version of the Georgia Guidestones.

i became british for a summer by Anika H. '26,N/A,0,"September 18, 2025","Home Blogs i became british for a summer by Anika H. '26 featuring an internship at bristol robotics lab September 18, 2025 in Uncategorized I worked in Bristol Robotics this summer through MISTI, MIT’s travel abroad program. I figured this could be fun, getting to work somewhere cool and also play tourist on the weekend in another country, but even the internship alone was by far the best work/research experience I’ve had. I met wonderful people that I’m still friends with and was genuinely excited about the research enough that I continued working on it (at least for now before I get hosed) after the internship ended. Over the summer, we made a human-hand-sized robotic hand with touch sensing. cool people! Part of what I liked so much about the job was that I got to see and help with so many other projects and assistive tech. One grad student was working on a robot that could perform manual labor tasks, and I helped her paint an imaginary wall for half an hour as she collected data on arm movements. Jebby helped with a group designing a smart walker with crash detection and voice activation. I think Maddie, the other MISTI student from my group, got the coolest gig of walking around in a space suit with a pneumatic exoskeleton as they logged movement data. maddie wearing the spacesuit and walking on a treadmill Dr. Nathan Lepora, professor of robotics and master of bowling. He took the group out to Roxy Lanes and got food after :) An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next I worked in the Dextrous Robotics group. My direct supervisor was technically Nathan, but because his schedule was packed so full it practically overflowed, we only saw him once or twice a week when we had group meetings. When he was here though, he would ask so many good questions it made up for him never being around. He seems to be popular around the lab (there are 3D prints of his head on some desks). When I had questions, I usually went to annoy Chris. He had his own projects to work on so I tried not to bother him too much, but when I inevitably needed clarification on something, he would pause mid-task to help me unless he was in the middle of a meeting. Our group didn’t usually hang out during lunch, so when I saw Jebby with a bunch of people on her first day at work, I went “ooh, new friends!” And snuck my way into their group under the pretense of also wanting to help do the daily crossword puzzles. the usual suspects at lunch When I first met them, I did the very American thing of “Hi! My name is Anika and here are all my hobbies and interests” from force of habit, despite the MISTI culture training sessions. I also tried to stop myself from yapping too much, though that eventually got easier as I had slightly less to say after the first month or so. :| One of the best parts of the internship were all the people here, who were all effortlessly cool, funny, well traveled, or insanely cracked at the research they do, or some combination of all of these things. Unlike the US, there’s no social pressure to talk in the UK. You can just vibe with the group and they’ll be totally fine with just having your presence around, but the more I hung around, the more I wanted to get to know them better. Fortunately for me, they didn’t seem to mind if I talked either (until I got comfortable enough to pull out my terrible terrible British accent). cool people We went out to the pub together a few times to hang out and get drinks. We yapped about stupid things for 4 hours straight, and raved about the hot nuts they sold. You could get a cup full of “spicy” crunchy peanuts for 2.50 pounds and it was worth every pence. Right before our internships ended, Yash, Jebby, and I went to see Superman together and walked around the city until late in the night. By the end of the summer, I made some incredible friends. Incoming Nerd Dump!!!!! electronics Because I was the one electrical engineer out of three other mechanical engineers working on the project, I got the really fun task of designing the fingertip and electronics that were meant to fit inside it. The main challenge was that everything had to fit into less than 4 cubic centimeters. This meant that the circuit ended up being the easy part and the layout was an absolute pain. Between the USB-C port, an FPC connector for the camera, another one for the LEDs, and the smallest ESP32 I could find (an ESP32-S3-PICO), I crammed it onto a two layer PCB that I couldn’t physically shrink any more than I already had. teeny little board While initially thought it was a great idea because everything fit neatly on the back of the fingertip, it soon came back to bite me in the behind when I realized I had to solder everything on by hand. If we ordered the board preassembled, I would have left before it even arrived, leaving no time to test it, which meant we ordered the parts and the PCB separately.

My First Few Weeks at MIT by Hala K. '29,N/A,0,"September 22, 2025","Home Blogs My First Few Weeks at MIT by Hala K. '29 … one year ago September 22, 2025 in Prepare for MIT Every freshman’s first few weeks at MIT tend to follow a predictable pattern – hunting for the best shortcuts across campus, making daily trips to Newbury, creating long notes lists of all the restaurants you want to try, wandering through the underground tunnels, spending WAY too much time in Stud 5,⁠01 Fifth floor of the Stratton Student Center (commonly referred to as the Stud) learning to share a tiny room with 1-3 “strangers,” and stopping through Killian Court just to stare at the Great Dome, still in disbelief that you’re actually here. Over the past 3 weeks, I’ve found myself doing all of these – but now, with a sense of deja vu. Cue the best 6 weeks of my life: MITES. First, the “important” stuff: MITES Summer is an on-campus summer program at MIT for rising high school seniors. During the program, students take five college-level courses, receive college admissions and financial aid advice, and receive mentorship from current undergraduate students. Now, the important stuff: When I first got my acceptance to the program – I was super intimidated for a lot of reasons. Growing up as the youngest of four, with a dad who insisted I kept a fire extinguisher handy just for boiling water, I never considered myself the most self-reliant person. The idea of packing my things to live alone across the country? Terrifying. According to thousands of Reddit posts, MITES is insanely hard to survive. So basically, I signed up for a summer of stress, sleep deprivation, and failure. Fun. IT’S MIT. As new fears kept piling on, I started “being realistic”: I should just reject my acceptance. There was no way I belonged at this program, let alone at MIT. But after getting a lecture (or ten) from friends and family, I came to my senses. “It’s only six weeks. I can power through.” Spoiler alert: I was wrong. I didn’t just power through MITES, I absolutely fell in love with it. I remember stepping out of my Uber with no idea where New House⁠02 One of MIT’s 11 residence halls was, my suitcase barely zipped shut, and sweat already dripping down my face. But the second I walked in, someone called me by name, grabbed the other end of my suitcase, and said, “Welcome to MITES!” The next six weeks flew by. And I don’t know exactly when it happened – maybe somewhere between crying over physics, memorizing the structures for every amino acid (still proud of that), and late-night Dave’s Hot Chicken runs – but by the end, I had found a second family. And while I can’t fit six weeks of stories into one blog post, I can tell you a few that made me fall in love with the program, and with MIT. Engineering Design Each MITES student takes one “project course” – a hands-on STEM class that runs throughout the summer and ends with a final project. The options included Genomics, Machine Learning, Engineering Design, Architecture, and Embedded Systems. After going back and forth between Machine Learning and Engineering Design for what felt like forever, I decided to try something new and take Engineering Design. Best. Decision. Ever. The class started with designing a competitive “game,” then splitting into teams to build a robot that could win it. And at the end of the six weeks, there was a huge competition that the entire MITES community came to watch. For our cohort, we created a game where robots had to remove tennis balls from an elevated platform and score them into a zone on the opposite side of the board. After three weeks of hard work, my group finally completed our robot and not to brag, but it was really good. However, there was one major problem: it was too wide. Technically, it could get through the obstacles but it took a painfully long time. So, it’s 9 PM the night before the competition, and we’re all sitting there knowing our robot has potential… but probably wouldn’t make it far. After an hour of testing, debating, testing again, and spiraling a little, we made a reckless decision that no one else supported: we were going to cut three inches off the robot. That meant taking apart every width-related piece, cutting it down, and rebuilding everything… in two hours. It was chaotic, exhausting, and honestly one of the funnest nights I’ve ever had. And while everyone thought the robot that had once been a shoo-in for the win was doomed… the clock struck midnight and bippity boppity boo, WE DID IT! So, without further ado, let me introduce you to the one and only: The Weedkiller Close-up of our robot (before we shortened it) Post-victory photo with my TA, Jan, at the official competition.

an infinite nine year old by Caleb M. '27,N/A,0,"September 23, 2025","Home Blogs an infinite nine year old by Caleb M. '27 and the infinite nineteen year old he became September 23, 2025 in Uncategorized The first time I walked down that hallway, the world was white. Many years later, I’d learn that that hallway was actually a ‘corridor’—an infinite one, at that. Dramatically, slash if I were into telling fables, I would say something like “I’d also come to learn that the world was white because of something called ‘snow.’” That would, however, be the most false thing I’ve ever said, because I obviously knew what snow was and had seen it multiple times before the day of this story. I was nine and grew up in Texas. It had snowed before. Anyway. The first time I walked down that infinite corridor, I was nine years old. My parents had always believed that one of the most important things that you could do was travel—to see the world and peek into the experiences of people beyond the metaphysical walls of Sachse, Texas, where I’d grown up. They had immigrated from Ethiopia to the United States a few years before I was born, so their entire life since then had been one loooong trip away from home. Yet they made the best of it, and throughout my childhood they took my older sibling Raiye and I on a vast array of adventures across the United States and occasionally across the ocean to Europe and, eventually, back home to Ethiopia. One of my oldest memories is asking my parents to bring me back the real Thomas the Tank Engine when they took Raiye to Kentucky when I was 3 and I stayed home with my grandmother. Suffice to say, they did NOT bring me back the real Thomas the Tank Engine. I’m also not confident why I thought he was in Kentucky. Nonetheless… I’ve been surrounded by travel all my life. The winter break of 4th grade, my dad—who had just got a new job as a professor at a college in Dallas—had a conference in a city far north from our humble Texan suburbs: Boston, Massachusetts. So the four of us packed our bags (I think I was still young enough to share a suitcase with Raiye, who was at the time 11), hopped on an airplane, and took what I didn’t know would be the first of many flights between DFW and BOS. We spent a couple days exploring the city, visiting the common, and doing the regular Boston tourist things. everybody say “aww.” “aww!” And then, one day, we visited two old buildings. Which isn’t shocking for Boston, but these two buildings (or groups of buildings, to be more specific) were quite special. The first one was a green field-of-sorts surrounded by tall, red brick buildings on every side. Tall gates surrounded the complex, and stepping through felt like leaving the city street surrounding it into a whole new little world. I remember walking through the grass and looking at the trees, hearing a name that I knew well—Harvard. There was crimson all about, and the sun shone on the greenery of the Yard. Students and tourists alike roamed about, and the entire scene felt rather idyllic, a brief portal into a world of red bricks and a million sidewalk paths spearing across the greenery. The second one was a little less frilled with fanfare. I remember entering through a door surrounded by a bunch of columns, and there aren’t many columns in Texas so I can actually say this was probably one of the few times I’d seen pillars that imposing. The weather had turned and it wasn’t as warm anymore, and there were no huge stretches of green around this part of town. If my memory serves, it was pretty dimly lit, fairly empty. I remember it feeling very brownish-green, in that deep patina’d-bronze way. I remember a long hallway that seemed to go on and on. I remember seeing a million posters for everything under the sun covering every square inch of both walls as we continued down the scarcely populated hallway. This one might be completely bull, but I distinctly remember a poster that looked like a Target logo with red and blue rings further down the way. Then, I remember the hallway opening into a larger lobby area. There were three big doors, and outside of those three big doors, a huge field was open for exploration and play. And what made that huge field so amenable to play? Snow. Now. I did mention earlier that I had absolutely seen snow before because I was not three. That being said, however, I had never seen snow like this. Snow in Texas doesn’t fall too heavy, doesn’t stick, and doesn’t let you do much with it. This? This was real, authentic, New England snow, deep enough to sink in and wet enough to build with. And that, I will admit, was pretty new. I remember as the posters and hallway slipped off my mind as Raiye and I rushed, hand-in-hand, through those giant doors and past even bigger columns and out onto the heavy layer of cloudy pillow that sprawled over the entire lawn. I remember grabbing fistfuls of it, throwing it at my sibling and giggling as I ran away from the ensuing counterattack, biting into it, building a little “fort” as well as a nine year old and a",4,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/an-infinite-nine-year-old/
[Guest Post] Rediscovering en Plein Air Painting by Allison E. '27,N/A,0,"September 17, 2025","Home Blogs [Guest Post] Rediscovering en Plein Air Painting by Allison E. '27 by Elisa X. '26, MEng '26 September 17, 2025 in Art, Literature, Music, MIT Life, Personal Projects, Projects, Summer View all This post is written by the wonderful Elisa X. ’26 / MEng ’26! Since I started college, my go-to fun fact when introducing myself is that I enjoy painting & drawing. As the semesters passed at MIT, this fun fact started feeling disingenuous as I strayed further and further away from this hobby. Now as I am starting my fourth year at MIT as a dual senior and MEng student,⁠01 Essentially, I am starting my MEng in EECS while completing a few leftover undergrad requirements. I still plan to graduate with my undergrad degree with the rest of my class in Spring 2026 then with my MEng in Fall 2026. only my closest friends really knew I painted in the past, mostly due to the occasional random conversation about art. In fact, funnily enough, I didn’t know my entire friend group had their own side interests in art (digital art, comic design, watercolor, sculpture, etc.) until over a year after we first met. At MIT, my aim was to maximize my experience. I told myself to expand my horizons and get out of my comfort zone. Over the past three years at MIT, I chased all sorts of side adventures, determined to make the most of my time: co-hosting a radio program, teaching biology in Italy, organizing logistics for MIT Science Olympiad, sailing on the Charles, and even helping a friend with an early-stage startup.⁠02 Crazily, he later dropped out, and his re-imagined startup just raised Series A! Along the way, I formed core memories too, like spontaneously road-tripping to Vermont for a total solar eclipse⁠03 The Great North American Eclipse on April 8th, 2024! and attending the world figure skating championships in Boston. While I do not regret doing any of this exploration, in the midst of all these new experiences, I side-tracked away from that comfort zone I once had. The most I did to reconnect with my artistic side was a half-semester Chinese calligraphy course I crammed into my schedule last semester. Ironically, despite my busy workload then, it was one of the classes I dedicated the most time to (due to how relaxing and fun it was), and my skills improved exponentially. My First Voyage into en Plein Air Painting I am very fortunate to have taken numerous art classes growing up with supportive teachers who nurtured my budding skills. Although I learned how to use most 2-D art mediums, my favorite was always paints, particularly acrylic due to its versatility in layering and fast drying time. During the beginning of the pandemic in my sophomore year of high school, I would frequently get bored lying around the house all day—so I started taking my full acrylic setup outdoors to paint en plein air,⁠04 <em>En plein air</em>, or the practice of creating art outdoors, was popularized by the 19th century impressionists like Claude Monet due to the new widespread availability of portable oil paint tubes. or in open air in French. Afternoon along the Chattahoochee River. Acrylic on canvas, 2020. Site of one of my first en plein air paintings along the Chattahoochee River near my home in GA. An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next The process of en plein air was quite different from how I approached crafting art pieces in the studio. For these artworks, I would thoroughly plan a compelling narrative along with the composition and colors—then spend dozens of hours refining even the smallest details. For my first few en plein air paintings, I strived to convey the scene perfectly, unable to finish the piece in one sitting. Eventually, with more and more practice, I learned to let go and just capture the essence of the moment. How I Rediscovered en Plein Air Painting After years of limited painting, the hardest part was accumulating the activation energy to get started again. Thanks to my summer internship, I finally had something that was quite foreign to an MIT student during the school year: work-life balance. Suddenly, I had so much extra time that I didn’t know what to do with it. I started off mindlessly scrolling on my phone then decided I wanted to do something more meaningful with my time, particularly away from the screen. My CS internship already involved me staring at a screen for hours on end. So on a random evening after work in August, I spontaneously busted out my old watercolor kit from layers of packed storage bags and wandered to the Charles River along Harvard to paint the sunset from life. Sunset over the CharlesWatercolor, gouache & pen on paper, 2025 En plein air painting was such a stark contrast from my MIT experience. At MIT, I was always in a rush; I self-identify as a meticulous planner, trying to anticipate my next steps months and even years in advance. With en plein air painting, I couldn’t anticipate my next stroke, let alone predict what the final piece would look like.

Time dilation by Taylor L. '29,N/A,0,"September 23, 2025","Home Blogs Time dilation by Taylor L. '29 to the Infinite, and beyond September 23, 2025 in Uncategorized Every roommate I’ve lived with quickly discovers my hidden superpower: I am invulnerable to alarms in the morning, no matter how loud or obnoxious. If I wake up, it’s not because of a clock, but instead purely through the strength of hopes, dreams, affirmations, and prayers. Accordingly, my Kryptonite is waking up super early (before 11am). I don’t even want to admit how many first period tardies I had in my senior year of high school. Suffice to say, punctuality has never been my strong suit. My saving grace for the past few weeks has been MIT time. Every class starts five minutes after its posted time and ends five minutes before (ex: a 9am class begins at 9:05 and ends at 9:55). In theory, this is supposed to give you a ten-minute buffer if you have consecutive classes. Do I have any consecutive classes? No. Am I riding the coattails of everybody who has to sprint from Sloan ⁠01 business school to the end of the Infinite ⁠02 long (~1/6th of a mile) hallway that cuts through the main academic building twice a week? Of course I am. I’ve been in 8.01 (Physics: Classical Mechanics) for two weeks now (and I haven’t been late at all, thanks to MIT time). Like most things here, the class moves quickly. But out of everything I’ve learned so far, the idea of reference frames has especially stuck with me: things look different depending on your perspective. Taken to its extreme, reference frames lead to a phenomenon called time dilation, in which, paradoxically, time passes slower the faster that you’re moving (thanks Einstein!). I couldn’t explain the math behind it to you yet, but I can definitely say that stepping into MIT feels like stepping into a physics problem on time dilation. It’s very easy to feel windswept here. I’ve started to use Google Calendar for the first time, and now there’s a ton of colorful rectangles demanding I be at this place, at this time, to do this certain thing. It’s a rewarding type of busyness ⁠03 I like Google’s definition of busyness: 'the state or condition of having a great deal to do' and I’ve never learned so much in such a short time before, but it nonetheless requires an adjustment to a faster-paced day. There’s still a ton of small little breaks in the continuum here, though: physics assignments are due at 11:00 instead of 11:59 so I stress out at 10:59 instead and can spend the next hour relaxing, and I stand in a very long line to get stir fry at New Vassar during lunch, and I get ten minutes between classes to take a nice stroll through the Outfinite ⁠04 the outdoor counterpart of the Infinite to enjoy the not-cold Boston weather while it lasts. It’s in those moments of stillness where I feel super time-dilated, where I stop and think for a second and look back at how much has passed in what seems like an instant. I spent this past summer soaking in the last dregs of my hometown before leaving it to see the rest of the whole wide world, and those three months spent in my comfort zone feel just as packed as my first month at MIT. Every moment has been so full. I’m still in that awkward middle phase where my poorly-decorated room and my walk to class and the new friends I’ve met all feel familiar one second and foreign the next. I do wonder, sometimes, how long I have before the weather gets colder, the novelties wear off, and it all becomes business as usual. It’s nice to have that Gcal, then, as some sort of structure, a map to follow in case I remember that I moved away from the only home I’ve had in my eighteen years. But some of my fondest memories so far have been made outside of those colorful rectangles. It’s the simple, slow, or spontaneous things, like watching Sunday football on the third floor of Maseeh (go Panthers!), or the weekly The Summer I Turned Pretty ⁠05 all good things must come to an end, which is why there’s still a movie on the way debrief in the lounge right outside my door, or even waking up to the sun shining through my window on days where my first class is a 10(:05)am. I shouldn’t have to mention that time moves fast here, but it also moves slow, and I’ve found that the whitespaces of my calendar are just as full as the little colorful blocks. business school⁠ back to text ↑ long (~1/6th of a mile) hallway that cuts through the main academic building⁠ back to text ↑ I like Google’s definition of busyness: 'the state or condition of having a great deal to do⁠ back to text ↑ the outdoor counterpart of the Infinite⁠ back to text ↑ ⁠ back to text ↑ Share this post Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Share on Facebook Share by Email Subscribe to the RSS Feed Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

"[Guest Post] This is Junior Lab, not Junior Theory by Ellie F. '28",N/A,0,"September 1, 2025","Home Blogs [Guest Post] This is Junior Lab, not Junior Theory by Ellie F. '28 By Jorian B. '25 September 1, 2025 in Classes 8.13, or as it is more commonly known, Junior Lab or JLab, is the first experimental class in the “standard” 8 path. Most 8s take it Junior Fall⁠01 hence the Junior in the name after >=3 semesters of theory classes. The first few weeks (the Intro Period) are spent ensuring everyone has a common base of experimental skills. Practically, this means many small tasks in areas such as programming, statistics, LaTeX, and electronic equipment. You then do an “intro” experiment, either the Photoelectric Effect or Michelson Interferometry, which is a test-run for the workflow of a “full” experiment. For the intro experiment, there are only 3 hours of data collection (as opposed to the normal 15 hours) but you still give a full 15-minute presentation and write a 4-page paper. These are graded for completion! The format is hard the first time, but much easier the second so this is your chance to do paper and with no consequences if you miss the mark. The comments from your professor and your first practice will then make your first graded assignments go much smoother. Then, you choose two “full” experiments to work on for 5 lab sessions and write an associated paper + presentation (I did Johnson and shot noise and 21 cm radio astrophysics, two amazing experiments 10/10 I absolutely recommend). Everyone designs their own 3rd experiment using a pair of CosmicWatches, which measure muon flux. At the end, you polish your favorite presentation and give it in front of the whole class (not just the professor and TA) and any other people who might drop in. Look at how much stuff is packed into the first three weeks. It is literally ⅓ of the calendar 😭 JLab has a bad reputation. It is a class that people hear about before they even declare physics. Some common phrases to describe it are “stressful,” “time sink,” “frustrating,” and “draining.” For some of us though, JLab is one of the best classes in the physics curriculum. I’m here to tell you why this class is amazing. In the intro period, there is a discussion regarding what constitutes a good lab notebook.⁠02 because physicists should maintain one There are several funny things in the sample notebooks⁠03 including a gif of an owl swimming but this is my favorite part. First of all, every day is calibration day. Secondly, the phrase “I love electromagnets”⁠04 a very understandable sentiment has three words in it. ‘I’ has one letter in it. Sean⁠05 the fearless leader of the lab staff mispelled every word in that sentence, and I crack up every time I see this. Even your instructors make typos :) This series of comments does kind of encompass JLab: mistakes, funny moments, and experimental physics. JLab was the first place I felt I 100% belonged in physics. Coming into JLab, I was under the impression that most physicists were theorists. I didn’t think I was a “real” physics major because I liked hands-on work. As an engineering double major (in Course 16, AeroAstro), I cared about building things, testing, and troubleshooting. As far as I saw, physics majors cared about math, creating thought experiments⁠06 which are exactly what they sound like; you imagine an experiment and then do the math , and the innate beauty of equations. I thought my interest in physics was that of an enthusiastic amateur but that I didn’t have the “right personality” to be a physicist. Enter JLab. For the first time in 8, I saw myself in my instructors. My professor, TAs, and the lab staff were excited about hands-on work. They talked about real, imperfect systems, not idealized equations. Answers to my questions were grounded in observables. The weird effects from the design of each specific apparatus were considered important, not details to be brushed off because they’re not “fundamental.” One of my friends once described 8.06⁠07 Quantum Mechanics III as “systems aren’t in equilibrium and how to cope with that.” In a similar vein, JLab is “systems aren’t isolated and how to cope with that.” It had always bothered me that physics PSETS seemed contrived. In JLab suddenly my professors wanted to talk about all the extraneous effects besides the theory being studied. This was eye-opening: I misunderstood a huge portion of the profession. Experimental physics combined things I loved in both engineering and physics: it was hands-on and the driving question was “why” (whereas in engineering it is closer to “how”). Initially, I thought that they (the powers above in the physics department) had taken an engineering class and disguised it as a physics lab class because the activities in the intro period were so reminiscent of lab and design questions on my engineering PSETs. Engineering made JLab feel familiar.⁠08 But they are not equivalent. Experimental physics approaches engineering, just as theoretical physics approaches math. It was amazing to learn that physicists care about the ",14,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/guest-post-this-is-junior-lab-not-junior-theory/

'28 my phone's storage space hates me September 23, 2025 in Events, Miscellaneous, Personal Projects, Personal Travel i have taken two thousand, four hundred and forty photos since i came to MIT. my photo album conveniently lists them in chronological order, one after the other, in perfect linear narrative since i first stepped on campus. but i’ve found, increasingly, that memories don’t work that way. i’ve found that memories don’t often fall in orderly queues aligned with time; they meander and bifurcate and grow into each other. each place on campus and in boston — classrooms, dining halls, dorms, street intersections, parks — evoke moments in the past, or sometimes collections of moments spread over months at a time. thankfully for us, google photos not only displays its standard chronological view, but also lets you see where you took your photos, in the form of a heat map: 8 photos a day, for around three hundred days same map, but zoomed in on MIT (the big red cluster in the first picture) An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next each cluster on the map — bright red and orange — indicates a spot of high photo density and a clump of memories. here are some of the places that have the most memories: 1. massachusetts ave crossing outside lobby 7 like most students, i made the daily pilgrimage last year from my dorm in the west side of campus to my classes in the east side, and then back again in the afternoon. a pedestrian crossing across mass ave bridges the two sides — possibly the most iconic crossing on campus. november 7, 2024. the setting sun roughly aligns with the crossing and the infinite corridor in the days before and after mithenge december 11, 2024 december 24, 2024: my last few moments in boston for the fall semester, hauling a suitcase through fresh snow at 6 am january 20, 2025 An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next 2. 6.2000 lab the past semester, i took an intro lab in electrical engineering. sadly, i ditched most of the lectures and recitations⁠01 my bed was cozier , but i did try to make it to each lab session every friday afternoon. for a class that delayed the start of my weekend by three hours, it was incredibly fun and gratifying! we made a piano of light: a frequency-modulated laser morse code transmitter: and, of course, two op-amps passionately in love: 3. back side of simmons the front entrance of my dorm, simmons, faces vassar street. there isn’t much reason to go around the back side — it’s a thin sliver of lawn bordered by railroad tracks and populated by just a few lawn chairs. one december night, though, it started snowing. i hadn’t seen snow in years as a native of los angeles; from my tenth-floor window i saw the parking lot outside blanketed in miraculous soft white. at that moment, i was drafting my final linguistics essay with my friends alice ’27 and sovannjet ’27; we rushed down the elevator and out the back door and our faces were met with a rush of snowflakes in the air: my friends were sophomores then, so they had already experienced a boston winter and were well-acquainted with the sensation of ice on bare skin. but for me, it was tantalizingly novel; i gazed skyward and ran through the snow and gulped mouthfuls of ice from the air. i wanted to live this moment forever — forever and ever beneath windy sky and clouds and breaths of snow. when we finally went back upstairs, my friends noticed that my hair was full of glistening ice. 4. fourth-floor stata balcony last year, winterfest was held on december 10 in the stata center’s first-floor lobby. we lined up for hot chocolate and peppermint and gingerbread cookies. i got hot chocolate and waited for my friends to arrive so we could sit together. but after around fifteen minutes, they never came, so i searched for a place myself. eventually, i went outside in the freezing cold and sat on a plastic table on the fourth-floor of balcony of the stata building. it was foggy and dark and murkily silent and i could only see the ghostly outline of building 56 across the sea of fog from where i was sitting. but it was calm, and i sat there underneath the balcony lights and wrapped warmly in a puffer jacket, sipping hot chocolate with molten marshmallows and staring into the distance and sipping hot chocolate and staring. An arrow pointing right Previous An arrow pointing right Next i sat there for ten minutes, then twenty, until my last few sips of hot chocolate were already cold. it was uncomfortably chilly but i didn’t want to ever leave. i would come back to the balcony a few more times, once after i finished one of my fall finals and once during iap, but i never sat there for more than a few moments before i returned to the warmth inside. 5. charleston shipyard i visited boston with my family around two years ago, before i had any suspicion that i would one day be accepted to MIT. one november day, we walked along the freedom trail⁠",21,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/picture-the-world/
3 Simple Steps for Making New Friends by Victor D. '27,N/A,0,"September 17, 2025","Home Blogs 3 Simple Steps for Making New Friends by Victor D. '27 Guide to Meeting People September 17, 2025 in Challenges, How to Human “You can do whatever you want—well, maybe not anything you want. But you can come and go. You can do anything and you don’t have to do anything.” – Maria Kalman My heart was nearly jumping out of my chest when I entered the MIT admissions office for the first time during Sin Limite.⁠01 Admitted students weekend primarily geared towards students of Latine/Hispanic descent Nervous was an understatement: I felt like I was shutting down. After checking in and dropping my bags in a sea of other bags, I was ushered into a room with the other Sin Limite attendees. I had arrived a bit late, and it seemed like everyone in the room already knew somebody.⁠02 This might not be so far from reality: as I’ve learned, many—dare I say most—MIT admits already knew someone at the Institute, whether that was a sibling, a friend from their high school, or even an acquaintance from Science Bowl. I knew nobody: I was the only admit from my high school. I grabbed some snacks from the plastic, gray foldable table at the center of the room, and quietly slid to the edge of the room. Paradoxically, I was desperate to be and not to be noticed: maybe somebody would come make it look like I belonged here by talking to me, while I also wished to be as invisible as possible, fearing I looked strange for hovering over the room… I’m currently reading “On Looking,” a book where author Alexandra Horowitz goes on urban walks with people of various professions, identities, and conditions,⁠03 With an infant, geologist, typographer, illustrator, insect tracker, raccoon researcher, PPS (Project for Public Spaces) president, two doctors, a blind woman, a sound engineer, and a dog. to highlight how our expertise and life experience impacts our perspective. Her walk with illustrator Maria Kalman was particularly salient to me. Horowitz writes how she was struck by how effortlessly Kalman floated between spaces and people, whether that was a church or a senior center. Horowitz describes Kalman’s approach to navigating the city as: “Take a left where you ordinarily would take a right, open the gate to the block garden you’ve never visited, view the passerby as a person who is waiting for you to speak to him.” I think it’s also a great set of steps for how to socialize and discover new people. “Take a left where you ordinarily would take a right.” I used to like to take every elevator and every stairwell in Burton Conner.⁠04 One of MIT's undergraduate dorms Why? Well, otherwise, I wouldn’t run into so many people! We are creatures of habit. We seek repetition, symmetry, and order; our brains even change physically by developing neural pathways that reward repetitive behavior.⁠05 Admittedly, I'm not a neuroscientist, but here's a source: https://mcgovern.mit.edu/2022/09/07/making-and-breaking-habits/ In a space like a dormitory, wherein there’s some 6+ ways to get to my room, all of which are efficient, why not vary? Soon, you realize you’re seeing—and interacting with—entirely different spaces and people; you walk up the stairs to take the elevator closest to the Porter Room⁠06 One of Burton Conner's event spaces when you hear music; apparently, it’s the “Balkan Dance”; and you’re waltzing in. For some reason, your roommate is there… you remember they have a very peculiar fascination for Slovenia, and now you’re meeting tons of new people by helping your roommate talk to various people in the crowd to identify a Slovenian person. Sometimes, I would take the Conner-side⁠07 BC is split into two sides that are still part of the same building: Burton, and Conner. elevator(s) instead of the Burton one… “Wait, no way, I haven’t seen you in forever! How’s it going?” By the time you reach the 4th floor (which is technically the 5th),⁠08 BC was the first building in the United States I visited with 0-indexing for floors. you’ve just reconnected with an old acquaintance and he’s going to share some delicious stir fry he made with you. You’ve never seen him take the Burton-side elevator. The amount of interactions I’ve had outside BC that begin like, “I feel like I know you from somewhere…” and you both realize you’ve already been pressing “3rd” for them for the past few months because, somehow, you’re already familiar. And this gentle familiarity, despite maybe never having exchanged a word, is ripe for a future connection. By deviating from your usual paths, you’ll be able to circumstantially “meet” those with different dispositions from yours, even if it’s as simple as “I prefer the Outfinite”⁠09 The complement to the “Infinite Corridor”, the Outfinite is the Infinite (which is the long stretch of corridors starting in Lobby 7 connecting through all of main campus), except it’s outside. or “I prefer this elevator because it’s more square than the others.” “Open the gate to the block garden you’ve never visited.” One day while s",1,https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/3-simple-steps-for-making-new-friends/
